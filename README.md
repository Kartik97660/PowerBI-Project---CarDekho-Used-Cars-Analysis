# PowerBI-Project - CarDekho-Used-Cars-Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study built using a real-world used car dataset inspired by CarDekho listings.
The objective is simple and practical:

Understand pricing, performance, usage patterns, and market behavior in the used car ecosystem.

This is not a dashboard-for-the-sake-of-it project.
It focuses on business questions, insight extraction, and decision-oriented visuals.

# Key Business Questions Answered

Which car models dominate the used car market?

What brands command the highest selling prices?

How do mileage, power, and engine capacity trade off?

Which fuel types show higher vehicle usage?

How do manual vs automatic cars differ in performance?

Who sells more cars — dealers or individuals?
If your dashboard can’t answer questions like these, it’s useless. This one does.

# 📊 Dashboards Included
1️⃣ Executive Summary

High-level KPIs for quick decision-making:

Total cars sold

3️⃣ Drive Insights

Performance and usage analysis:

Mileage vs Power (scatter analysis)

Average kilometers driven by fuel type

Driving mode comparison (Manual vs Automatic)

This section exposes real-world trade-offs, not marketing claims.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, dashboarding

SQL – Table creation & data understanding

Excel / CSV – Raw dataset handling

DAX Measures – KPIs, averages, comparisons

No fake tools. No buzzword stuffing.

# 📂 Dataset

Used car listings with attributes like:

Brand & Model

Selling Price

Mileage

Engine Capacity

Power (BHP)

Fuel Type

Transmission

Seller Type

Kilometers Driven

Dataset cleaned and modeled for analytics, not just visuals.

# 🔍 Key Insights 

Manual cars dominate volume, but automatics show higher power variance.

Luxury brands (Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, Bentley) skew average price heavily.

LPG and Diesel cars tend to have higher average KM driven, indicating usage intensity.

Mileage and power show an inverse relationship beyond a threshold — no free lunch.

# 🚀 Why This Project Is Strong

Let’s be honest:

This is not a tutorial copy

This is not a Kaggle medal chase

This does simulate real analyst work

You’ll see:

Clear metric selection

Logical dashboard segregation

Business-first storytelling

Clean visual hierarchy

# 🤝 Open for Feedback & Collaboration

I actively invite critique.

If you think:

A metric is misleading

A visual can be improved

A business angle is missing

👉 Fork and suggest enhancements
👉 Or connect with me directly

That’s how real analysts grow.

# 📌 Future Enhancements
